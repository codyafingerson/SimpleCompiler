# Simple "Compiler" ðŸ¤“
Hi there! This is just a simple compiler project that I created just for fun. 
It does not do much (as of yet), but it does demonstrate the basic concepts of a compiler. 
It is written in TypeScript. The project is open source and can be 
found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/codyafingerson/SimpleCompiler).

This project is hosted at [https://simple-compiler.vercel.app](https://simple-compiler.vercel.app/about)

# Information
